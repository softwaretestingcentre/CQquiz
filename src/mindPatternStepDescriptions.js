    <p>You naturally "show and tell." You enjoy looking at possibilities - flipping through catalogs, going window-shopping or people-watching 
    and talking to yourself or someone else about what you see. You make steady eye contact and create a visual impression with the clothes you wear, 
    which are usually quite colorful and well coordinated. You habitually are attracted to anything in print - novels, billboards, even cereal boxes. 
    You can keep masses of visual details stored in your mind and remember them easily. Your feelings are written all over your face. 
    In fact, by looking at your face, others may know how you feel before you are even aware of it.</p>
    <p>Your words express a lot of energy and are often very persuasive, selling or building a case for something. 
    You characteristically teach by telling stories in great detail and using many metaphors to paint pictures for your listener, 
    with your hands emphasizing important points you have just made. When you speak, you use visual vocabulary - words such as 
    "see", "look", "colourful", "show", and "bright", and phrases such as "I can see your point" and "see you later." 
    You often use fillers, such as "um", "like", or "you know," between thoughts.</p>`,

    <p>People are often struck right away by your visual meticulousness. By nature, you are someone who can immediately spot the single typo 
    in the hundred-page report. How you look is extremely important to you, you want your clothes, body, possessions, and surroundings 
    to match an inner image you are trying to create. You connect with others most easily by making eye contact. 
    You can maintain it steadily but may have to close your eyes or move to listen in depth. You instinctively feel what you see.</p>
    <p>You usually have pent-up energy right beneath the surface and so physical activity tends to be an important emotional outlet for you. 
    You may be a voracious reader, unless you were taught to read phonetically, in which case you might stick to magazines or newspapers. 
    You may like to take copious notes in meetings to stay engaged.</p>
    <p>In large groups, you can be rather quiet. With one or two peers or in small groups, however, you can be very talkative, 
    jumping from topic to topic. It is typical for you to ask a lot of questions. People may often tell you to "get to the point," 
    because you may make connections in your speech that may not be understandable to the listener. 
    Gesturing, moving, or touching is essential to help you find your words.</p>
