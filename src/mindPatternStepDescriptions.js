    to match an inner image you are trying to create. You connect with others most easily by making eye contact. 
    You can maintain it steadily but may have to close your eyes or move to listen in depth. You instinctively feel what you see.</p>
    <p>You usually have pent-up energy right beneath the surface and so physical activity tends to be an important emotional outlet for you. 
    You may be a voracious reader, unless you were taught to read phonetically, in which case you might stick to magazines or newspapers.

    <p>In large groups, you can be rather quiet. With one or two peers or in small groups, however, you can be very talkative, 
    jumping from topic to topic. It is typical for you to ask a lot of questions. People may often tell you to "get to the point,"
