    <h1>Thinking Talents</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Identifying your thinking talents begins with reading through each of
        the thirty-five talents in the "cards" below. All you need to remember
        about thinking talents are the following three characteristics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They are innate ways of thinking. That is, you've always been really
          good at doing them, even if you never had any specific training, and
          you tend to use them when faced with challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          You get natural joy and energy from using your thinking talents, and
          you don't burn out.
        </li>
        <li>
          You excel in using these talents and enjoy developing capacities with
          them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Understanding these aspects will help you distinguish thinking talents
        from skills, personality traits, or other capacities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thinking talent self-assessment works like a card game. You will see
        that each thinking-talent card has a label at the bottom that reads
        "ALWAYS-SOMETIMES-NEVER".
      </p>
      <p>
        As you read the cards that follow, click a label to select or deselect
        it. The first is for cards that describe: "This ALWAYS gives me energy".
        The second is for cards that describe: "This SOMETIMES gives me energy".
        The third is for cards that describe: "This NEVER gives me energy".
      </p>
      <p>
        As you go through the cards, thinking of all areas of your life, they
        will be listed on the right of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no way you can be wrong. As your awareness of thinking talents
        increases, you'll recognize things in yourself you never noticed before,
        so over time you might need to reconsider some of your choices. As your
        understanding grows, you can always change your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, when you have a breakthrough in your thinking, complete a
        task well, or have an experience that makes you feel fully alive, take a
        minute to reflect on what thinking talents you just used. It's also
        useful to notice how your talents show up for you in different domains
        of life: work, exercise, family, hobbies, or with different people.
        Through this broad spectrum of observations, you will collect insights
        that will be the optimal guide for using your thinking talents well.

        <h3>SHADOW ATTRIBUTES</h3>
        <p>
          Some people have difficulty identifying their thinking talents,
          because as a society we have been conditioned to focus attention on
          fixing our deficits rather than maximizing our strengths. Most
          training programs emphasize weaknesses that need to be improved.
          Furthermore, some cultures, religions, and family traditions consider
          modesty a virtue, thereby eclipsing the ability to even admit one's
          talents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we have developed an additional lens we call the "shadow
          attribute", to make it easier to recognize a talent. It's a way of
          understanding what the hidden talent is behind particular behaviors.
          For instance, the shadow attribute for optimism is "cheerleading."
          Jamie, no matter how bad things got, always cheered other people on,
          to the point where they rolled their eyes and said she was denying
          reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shadow attribute characteristically shows up when a talent is
          rough, excessive, or displayed in an unconstructive way. In fact, once
          Jamie recognized this as a shadow attribute of optimism, she learned
          the best time and way for the talent to shine. This is a very
          different outcome than if she had just thought of the opposite of
          optimism, which is pessimism. The value of recognizing the shadow
          attribute is that it can lead you to the hidden thinking talent that
          waits to be identified and developed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cards show the shadow attribute of each thinking talent. Review
          the cards, scanning for any attribute that stands out as very
          familiar. Decide if the associated thinking talent should be in the
          "ALWAYS" pile you created from the previous assessment.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start">
      <div class="talents-grid" id="talents-grid">
        <!-- Cards will be rendered here -->
      </div>
      <aside id="talent-summary" class="summary-aside">
        <h2 class="summary-heading">Your Selections</h2>
        <div id="analysis-btn-container" class="summary-btn-container">
          <button id="analysis-btn" class="summary-btn">Analysis</button>
        </div>
        <div class="summary-group">
          <strong class="always">Always</strong>
          <ul id="list-always" class="summary-list"></ul>
        </div>
        <div class="summary-group">
          <strong class="sometimes">Sometimes</strong>
          <ul id="list-sometimes" class="summary-list"></ul>
        </div>
        <div class="summary-group">
          <strong class="never">Never</strong>
          <ul id="list-never" class="summary-list"></ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Once you have sorted all the talents into these three categories, go
          to the "ALWAYS" group and edit it down to the five to eight strongest
          talents.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have more than eight, ask yourself which ones have always been
          true for you and always will be true for you; eliminate those that
          aren't quite as strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have fewer than five, go to the "SOMETIMES" group and add the
          strongest ones there to the "ALWAYS" group until you have five.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have talents in your "ALWAYS" group that you think of as
          irrelevant to your work, but if they fit the above criteria, please
          consider them thinking talents anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The five to eight cards remaining in the "ALWAYS" group will most
          accurately describe what you consider to be your dominant thinking
          talents.

              <h3>Discovering Your Blind Spots</h3>
              <p>Equally important as knowing your mind’s sweet spots—the talents you have, the talents that are hidden, and how they combine—is recognizing your mind’s blind spots, which are the talents you lack. People worry and stress in the quadrants where they have blind spots. If you don’t have “feeling for others,” for example, you may worry about how people will react to you. If you don’t have “making order,” you worry because you have trouble organizing and prioritizing. If you don’t have “focusing,” you’re concerned about being easily distracted. We seem to know intuitively we are missing a natural ease and excellence of thinking in these areas, even if we fail to recognize it consciously. Conversely, you don’t worry in the domains where you have the necessary thinking talents, because you innately trust your capacity.</p>
              <p>Two common assumptions cause us to deny our blind spots. The first is the belief that we should all be competent at everything. The second is the belief that we should be able to think through and solve any issue independently. Both of these erroneous beliefs can lead to what I call “skilled mediocrity,” and they point to the inescapable fact that we need one another. Blind spots reveal where collaboration is necessary so you can give and get the support you need to produce excellence.</p>
              <p>Looking back to the thinking-talents map, notice if you have any quadrants that are devoid of thinking talents. These are your blind spots. Also notice which thinking talents are missing, because they too may be blind spots in certain situations.</p>
