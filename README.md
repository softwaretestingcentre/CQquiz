# Collaborative Intelligence

A series of interactive forms taken from the book Collaborative Intelligence by Dawna Markova and Angie McArthur.

These can be used to identify your tendencies in regard to:
- Mind Patterns
- Thinking Talents
- Inquiry
- Mind Share

By using these to identify your strengths and weaknesses - and those of your team-mates - you can all learn to work together more effectively.

# Running the app

The application was designed using BDD and built with Copilot assistance.

It runs as a web application on `http://localhost:3000/` after running the command: `npx ts-node src/server.ts`
